# FileRenamer

So, this one needs a bit of context.  I came home from uni for Christmas and got a lovely boxset of Star Trek TNG as a present.
Well, I intended on watching through it in my free time.  Slight issue - I forgot to bring it with me.
So I pirated it.  As far as I know, it's fine.  I own the pysical thing, I'll get the files off the Blu-Rays at a later date.

Anyway, they came in some horrible format of Star.Trek.The.Next.Generation.S01E03.Whatever.The.Episode.Name.Is.mp4.
So I made this to really quickly rename 7 seasons of this hell.
It's not overly interesting programming; it's not even difficult.
Reuse it somewhere if you want to.

Thinking I might make a configurable version because I forgot my One Punch Man boxset too...
